# # Design Specialized Agents for a Recommendation System
# 

# %% [markdown]
# Estimated time needed: **45** minutes
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Learning Objectives
# After completing this lab, you'll be able to:
# 
# - Design agent goals, backstories, and personas using LangChain
# - Create agent instances with clear responsibilities and expertise
# - Design tasks for each agent with structured descriptions and expected outputs
# - Apply ReAct and few-shot prompting patterns to agent design
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Introduction
# 
# In this lab, you will design a multi-agent system for restaurant and recipe recommendations. You will define six specialized agents, each with a distinct role in the recommendation pipeline:
# 
# 1. **User Profile Generator**: Analyzes user data to extract preferences and patterns
# 2. **RAG Retriever**: Queries vector databases for relevant restaurants and recipes
# 3. **Food Trend Analyst**: Identifies current food trends and popular ingredients
# 4. **Food Style Expert**: Analyzes cuisines, cooking methods, and flavor profiles
# 5. **Nutrition Expert**: Evaluates nutritional content and dietary restrictions
# 6. **Recommendation Expert**: Synthesizes all insights into final recommendations
# 
# By breaking down the recommendation task into specialized roles, you create a modular, maintainable system where each agent focuses on what it does best.
# 
# **Note:** Throughout this lab, you'll answer strategically placed questions designed to reinforce your learning and complete the checklist.

# ## **Screenshot requirement for this lab**
# 
# You will be prompted to take a screenshot and save it on your own device. You will need this screenshot either to answer graded quiz questions or to upload as your submission for the Final Project at the end of this course. You can use various free screen-grabbing tools or your operating system's shortcut keys to do this (for example, `Alt+PrintScreen` on Windows and `Command+shift+4` on Mac).
# **Note**: The screenshot can be saved with either the **.jpg** or **.png** extension.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ### Install the required libraries
# 
# All the required libraries are __not__ pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment. __You need to run the following cell__ to install them. This might take a few minutes.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ----
# 

# %%
# Run these in a terminal before executing this script:
# pip install openai==1.99.9
# pip install langchain==0.3.0
# pip install langchain-community==0.3.27
# pip install langchain-core==0.3.74
# pip install langchain_experimental==0.3.4

# %% [markdown]
# ### Import required libraries
# 
# Begin by importing the libraries and packages you will need to complete this lab.
# 

# %%
import os                         
from typing import List, Dict, Any                           
from openai import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate                             
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

# %% [markdown]
# ### Configure API access 
# 
# To use LangChain with OpenAI models, you need to configure your API key. For this lab, you'll use a placeholder approach. In production, you would set your actual OpenAI API key.
# 
# **Note**: If you have an OpenAI API key, you can set it here. Otherwise, you can proceed with the design phase without running the agents.
# 

# %%
# Set your OpenAI API key
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"

# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()

# Define the model to use
MODEL = "gpt-5"

# %% [markdown]
# ## Define agent roles, goals, and backstories
# 
# Each agent needs three core components:
# - **Role**: A concise title describing the agent's function
# - **Goal**: A clear statement of what the agent aims to accomplish
# - **Backstory**: A narrative that establishes expertise and personality
# 
# Let's define these for all six agents.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ### Agent 1: User Profile Generator
#

# ### Congratulations!
# You have successfully completed this lab.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ### Summary
# 
# In this lab, you defined six specialized agents for a multi-agent recommendation system:
# 1. **User Profile Generator**: Analyzes user data to extract preferences
# 2. **RAG Retriever**: Queries vector databases for relevant content
# 3. **Food Trend Analyst**: Identifies current food trends
# 4. **Food Style Expert**: Analyzes cuisines and flavor profiles
# 5. **Nutrition Expert**: Evaluates nutritional content and dietary fit
# 6. **Recommendation Expert**: Synthesizes insights into final recommendations
# 
# You designed roles, goals, and backstories for each agent, and created detailed task specifications with expected outputs. In the next lesson, you will integrate these agents into a coordinated workflow and test the complete system.
