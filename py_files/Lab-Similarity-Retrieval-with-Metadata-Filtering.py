# # **Similarity Retrieval with Metadata Filtering**
# 

# %% [markdown]
# Estimated time needed: **45** minutes
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Introduction
# 
# You constructed multimodal vector indexes for restaurant articles and food images using Chroma. With the indexing infrastructure established, the next step is to operationalize the **retrieval layer**, which is responsible for identifying relevant content at query time.
# 
# Similarity search forms the backbone of modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by enabling semantic matching between user queries and stored vector representations. However, in real-world applications, similarity alone is often insufficient. Production systems frequently require **structured constraints**, such as filtering by location, cuisine, or content source, to ensure that retrieved results satisfy business rules or user preferences.
# 
# To address this need, modern retrieval pipelines combine vector similarity with **metadata-aware filtering**. This hybrid strategy allows systems to narrow the candidate search space while preserving semantic relevance, improving both controllability and precision. Such designs are widely used in recommendation engines, multimodal search platforms, and large-scale RAG deployments.
# 
# In this lab, you will implement similarity-based top-k retrieval with optional metadata constraints over the persisted Chroma collections. You will perform semantic retrieval over restaurant articles and similarity search over the food image collection, observing how structured filters influence the final ranked results.
# 
# By the end of this lab, you will have built a reusable hybrid retrieval workflow that mirrors production systems. This retrieval layer will serve as the foundation for multimodal fusion and re-ranking in the next lesson.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Objectives
# 
# After completing this lab, you will be able to:
# 
# - Perform similarity-based top-k retrieval over vector databases  
# - Apply metadata constraints using Chroma filter expressions  
# - Implement hybrid similarity + filter retrieval workflows  
# - Analyze the effect of filtering on retrieval results  
# - Execute image-to-image similarity search using CLIP embeddings  
#

# ### Environment and database validation
# 
# Before performing retrieval, you need to verify that the multimodal vector databases created by you are available and properly populated.
# 
# This step ensures that:
# 
# - The Chroma persistence directory exists  
# - Both the article and image collections are accessible  
# - The vector indexes contain data  
# 
# Failing early at this stage prevents silent retrieval errors later in the pipeline and ensures that the environment is correctly configured.
# 

# %%
# ================================
# Verify vector database
# ================================

DB_DIR = str((Path.home() / "chroma_multimodal").resolve())

if not os.path.isdir(DB_DIR):
    raise RuntimeError(
        f"Vector database directory not found: '{DB_DIR}'. "
        "Please run Lesson 1 (Multimodal Vector Index Construction) first."
    )

article_db = Chroma(
    collection_name="restaurant_articles",
    persist_directory=DB_DIR,
)

image_db = Chroma(
    collection_name="food_images",
    persist_directory=DB_DIR,
)

n_articles = article_db._collection.count()
n_images = image_db._collection.count()

if n_articles <= 0 or n_images <= 0:
    raise RuntimeError(
        "One or more collections are empty. Please rerun Lesson 1 to rebuild the index."
    )

print(f"✅ Article vectors: {n_articles}")
print(f"✅ Image vectors:   {n_images}")

# ### Embedding model initialization
# 
# To perform a similarity search, queries must be encoded into the same vector spaces used during indexing.
# 
# In this step, we initialize:
# 
# - a **Sentence-Transformers model** for text embeddings (384-dimensional)  
# - a **CLIP image encoder** for image embeddings (512-dimensional)  
# 
# Both embedding pipelines apply L2 normalization, enabling efficient cosine similarity computation during retrieval.
# 

# %%
# ================================
# Initialize embedding models
# ================================

# ---- Text embedding model (384-d) ----
text_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

def embed_texts(texts, batch_size=64):
    return text_model.encode(
        texts,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        show_progress_bar=False,
        normalize_embeddings=True,  # cosine-ready
    ).astype(np.float32)

print("✅ Text embedder ready")


# ---- Image embedding model (512-d) ----
device = "cpu"
clip_name = "openai/clip-vit-base-patch32"
clip_model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(clip_name).to(device)
clip_processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(clip_name, use_fast=True)
clip_model.eval()

@torch.no_grad()
def embed_images(paths, batch_size=16):
    vecs = []
    for i in range(0, len(paths), batch_size):
        batch = paths[i:i+batch_size]
        imgs = [Image.open(p).convert("RGB") for p in batch]
        inputs = clip_processor(images=imgs, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
        feats = clip_model.get_image_features(**inputs)          # (B,512)
        feats = feats / feats.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)         # cosine-ready
        vecs.append(feats.cpu().numpy().astype(np.float32))
    return np.vstack(vecs)

# ### Retrieval utilities
# 
# You will define helper utilities that standardize how results are extracted and displayed from the Chroma vector database.
# 
# These utilities will:
# 
# - Unwrap Chroma’s nested query outputs  
# - Format retrieval hits for readability  
# - Expose key metadata fields 
# 
# This abstraction keeps the experimental code clean and allows the remainder of the lesson to focus on retrieval behavior rather than result parsing.
#

# Chroma returns lists-of-lists; unwrap the first query.

# ### Article similarity retrieval
# 
# You will implement a reusable retrieval function for restaurant articles.
# 
# This function will:
# 
# - Embed the natural language query  
# - Perform top-k cosine similarity search  
# - Optionally applies metadata filtering  
# - Return structured results for inspection  
# 
# The design follows a **filter-first hybrid retrieval pattern** commonly used in production RAG systems.

# ================================

# Similarity retrieval over restaurant articles with optional metadata filtering.
def retrieve_articles(query: str, k: int = 5, where: dict | None = None):

    q_vec = embed_texts([query])[0]  # 384-d, cosine-ready

    res = article_db._collection.query(
        query_embeddings=[q_vec.tolist()],
        n_results=k,
        where=where,
        include=["documents", "metadatas", "distances"],
    )
    return _unwrap(res)

print("✅ Article retrieval ready")


# %% [markdown]
# ### Image similarity retrieval
# 
# Next, you will implement image-to-image retrieval using CLIP embeddings.
# 
# Given a query image, the system will:
# 
# - Encode the image into a 512-dimensional vector  
# - Search the image collection by cosine similarity  
# - Optionally apply metadata constraints  
# 
# This enables cross-instance visual similarity search within the multimodal database.

# Similarity retrieval over food images using an image query.

    res = image_db._collection.query(
        query_embeddings=[q_vec.tolist()],

# ### Demo 1 — Article similarity search (no filter)
# 
# You will begin with a pure similarity search over the restaurant article collection.
# 
# This experiment demonstrates:
# 
# - Baseline semantic retrieval behavior  
# - Top-k nearest neighbor search  
# - Retrieval without metadata constraints  
# 
# The results serve as a reference for later filtered retrieval experiments.
# 

# %%
# ================================
# Demo 1 — Article similarity search (no filter)
# ================================

q = "cozy restaurant with noodles and warm atmosphere"

ids, docs, metas, dists = retrieve_articles(q, k=5, where=None)
print_hits(ids, docs, metas, dists, title="Demo 1 — Article similarity search (no filter)")

print("✅ Demo 1 complete")


# %% [markdown]
# ### Demo 2 — Article similarity search + metadata filter
# 
# You will now introduce **metadata-constrained retrieval**, a key technique for improving precision in real-world systems. In addition to semantic similarity, we apply structured filters (for example, by location or cuisine). 
# 
# This hybrid approach allows the system to:
# 
# - Narrow the candidate search space  
# - Enforce business or user constraints  
# - Improve relevance under structured requirements  
# 
# You may experiment with different metadata values present in the dataset to observe how filtering affects recall and ranking.
# 

# %%
# ================================
# Demo 2 — Article similarity search + metadata filter
# ================================

q = "handmade pasta and romantic dinner"

# ---- metadata constraint (must exist in your dataset) ----
where_filter = {"location": "Pasadena"}  # adjust if needed

ids, docs, metas, dists = retrieve_articles(q, k=5, where=where_filter)

if len(ids) == 0:
    print("⚠️ No results found with current filter.")
else:
    print_hits(ids, docs, metas, dists, title="Demo 2 — Article similarity search + metadata filter")
    
print("✅ Demo 2 complete")


# %% [markdown]
# ### Demo 3 — Image similarity search (image→image)
# 
# Finally, you will perform visual similarity retrieval using a stored food image as the query.
# 
# This experiment demonstrates:
# 
# - CLIP-based image embeddings  
# - Nearest neighbor search in visual space  
# - Optional metadata constraints on images  
# 
# The query image can be changed by modifying the `QUERY_INDEX` parameter, enabling interactive exploration of the image collection.
# 

# %%
# ================================
# Demo 3 — Image similarity search (image→image)
# ================================

meta_all = image_db._collection.get(include=["metadatas"])["metadatas"]

QUERY_INDEX = 10  # ← change this (0 … N-1) to try different images

if QUERY_INDEX >= len(meta_all):
    raise ValueError("QUERY_INDEX out of range.")

query_img = meta_all[QUERY_INDEX]["image_path"]

print(f"Query image: {query_img}")
img = Image.open(query_img)
img.thumbnail((300, 300))
img.show()
# display(Image.open(query_img))

# 1. Create an optional metadata filter for recipe images
where = {"source": {"$eq": "recipe"}}
where = None
# 2. Retrieve the top-5 most similar images using query_img
ids, docs, metas, dists = retrieve_images_by_image(query_img, k=5, where=where)

# 3. Display the retrieved results with metadata
if len(ids) == 0:
    print("⚠️ No results found with current filter.")
else:
    print_hits(ids, docs, metas, dists, title="Demo 3 — Image similarity search (image→image)")

print("✅ Demo 3 complete")
print("🎉 Similarity Retrieval with Metadata Filtering COMPLETE")

# ### 📸 Screenshot Submission Requirement
# 
# At the end of this lab, take a screenshot of the final code cell and its output, and name it 
# **M2L2_similarity_retrieval.jpg**.
# 
# Your screenshot must clearly show:
# 
# - A retrieval query (image)
# - Displayed top-K retrieved restaurant results (with metadata)
# - The final completion message:  
#   **"Similarity Retrieval with Metadata Filtering COMPLETE"**
# 
# This screenshot will later serve as a component for the assessment.
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Conclusion
# 
# In this lab, you implemented similarity-based retrieval with metadata constraints over multimodal vector databases. You compared unconstrained and constrained retrieval for restaurant articles and executed a visual similarity search over the food image collection.
# 
# These retrieval capabilities form the core of production-grade multimodal RAG systems and prepare the foundation for multimodal fusion and re-ranking in the next lesson.
