# # Build a Chatbot Interface for the Recommendation System
# 

# %% [markdown]
# Estimated time needed: **45** minutes
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Learning Objectives
# After completing this lab, you'll be able to:
# 
# - Build interactive chatbot interfaces using Gradio
# - Implement natural language intent classification for user requests
# - Extract user preferences from conversational input
# - Integrate multi-agent workflows into a chat interface
# - Format agent outputs for display in a user-friendly format
# - Add database management features to the chatbot
# - Deploy and test a complete chatbot application
# 

# %% [markdown]
# ## Introduction
# 

# %% [markdown]
# In this lab, you will build a chatbot interface for your multi-agent recommendation system using Gradio. The chatbot will:
# 
# 1. Understand user requests in natural language
# 2. Classify whether users want restaurant or recipe recommendations
# 3. Extract preferences like cuisines, dietary restrictions, and price range
# 4. Invoke the multi-agent workflow from Lesson 2
# 5. Present recommendations in a conversational, engaging format
# 6. Allow users to add, update, and delete items in the database
# 
# By the end of this lab, you will have a fully functional chatbot that anyone can use without writing code.
# 
# **Note:** Throughout this lab, you'll answer strategically placed questions designed to reinforce your learning.

# ## **Screenshot requirement for this lab**
# 
# You will be prompted to take a screenshot and save it on your own device. You will need this screenshot either to answer graded quiz questions or to upload as your submission for the Final Project at the end of this course. You can use various free screen-grabbing tools or your operating system's shortcut keys to do this (for example, `Alt+PrintScreen` on Windows and `Command+shift+4` on Mac).
# **Note**: The screenshot can be saved with either the **.jpg** or **.png** extension.
